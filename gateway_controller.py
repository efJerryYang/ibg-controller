IB Gateway Controller — Python + in-JVM Java agent replacement for IBC.

Single-file controller that:
  1. Launches IB Gateway directly via its install4j launcher.
  2. Drives the login dialog, 2FA dialog, and configuration dialogs via
     an in-JVM Java agent (loaded with -javaagent:) that exposes Swing
     operations over a Unix domain socket.
  3. Verifies every action by reading state back through the same agent.
  4. Signals readiness via /tmp/gateway_ready so socat starts only AFTER
     login succeeds and the main window is up.
  5. Stays alive monitoring the JVM and watching for re-auth events.

Why an in-JVM agent and not xdotool: xdotool synthesizes X events but
Swing's AWT subsystem filters them. AT-SPI2 (the original approach) was
abandoned in v0.5.12 after the java-atk-wrapper bridge was found to
deadlock on JProgressBar.setValue calls during login. The agent uses
Swing's own JTextField.setText() / AbstractButton.doClick() and reads
state back via the same APIs — the only mechanisms that actually work
against Gateway's hardened login form.

Why a single Python file: the upstream maintainer (gnzsnz) doesn't write
Java or Rust, and wants something he can read, debug, and patch when IB
ships a new dialog on a Friday night. Python stdlib + a small in-JVM
agent hits that bar.

for dialog catalog and edge cases. Original work by @rlktradewright (IBC).

    v0.6.2: hardened against a dual-mode-only race that surfaced after
    v0.6.1's diagnostic logging revealed it. Live mode transitions
    API_WAIT → CONFIG within ~3 s of the API port opening, with the
    EDT still processing post-2FA tear-down (modal=true 2FA dialog
    being disposed, "Authenticating..." overlay being torn down).
    Paper mode, which skips 2FA, hits the same code path with a
    quiescent EDT.

    Symptoms (pre-v0.6.2): agent CLICK 'Configure' returns OK (the
    JMenu's selected property flips), but the JPopupMenu's heavyweight
    peer window hasn't been realized by the time the follow-up
    CLICK 'Settings' walks Window.getWindows(). The agent reports
    ``ERR not_found type=button name=Settings`` and post-login config
    silently fails on live but works on paper.

    Three changes:

    1. Wait for the post-login window stack to settle before clicking
       Configure — no modal dialogs visible, no "Authenticating..."
       window present. Bounded so we eventually proceed even on
       Gateway showing a transitional window we haven't explicitly
       named.
    2. Inter-click delay between Configure and Settings raised from
       0.3 s to 1.0 s. That's the time the EDT needs to realize the
       JPopupMenu's heavyweight peer window when it's coming out of
       a busy state. Empirically 0.3 s was enough on a quiescent EDT
       (paper) and not enough on a busy one (live post-2FA).
    3. Outer retry: up to 3 attempts to open the dialog, with a 1 s

    Replaces the old ``sys.exit(1)`` terminus on paths where in-JVM

    frame, v0.4.4). In dual-mode the container won't restart on

    PIDs and only the exiting mode's process dies — the container
    stays up on the other mode's PID and this mode's JVM stays dead

    kill this mode's Gateway JVM, sleep the long CCP cool-down
    (default 20min) with NO JVM running on these credentials, then
    launch a fresh JVM and re-drive login. If the JVM is kept alive
    during the cool-down its internal "Attempt N: connecting to
    server" retry loop keeps hitting IBKR's auth server and keeps
    the CCP rate limiter armed — observed 2026-04-16 with v0.4.5,
    where a 20min cool-down with the JVM alive failed to clear CCP
    on the relaunch. v0.4.6 makes the cool-down genuinely silent.

    Not the v0.4.0 bug: v0.4.0 was kill+relaunch+retry with 60-600s
    gaps, too short for CCP to clear and each fresh handshake rearmed
    the limiter. v0.4.6 keeps the 20min duration but positions it so

    opened' failure into a specific, actionable error message.

    Gateway's auth protocol on the wire:
      1. TCP connect + SSL handshake
      2. Gateway logs 'Authenticating'
      3. Server replies with 'Received NS_AUTH_START'
      4. Gateway sends credentials
      5. Server replies with 'PostAuthenticate' or an error dialog
      6. Gateway opens the API port

    Three observed failure modes look identical at step 6 but leave
    different fingerprints in launcher.log:

      a) IBKR silent cooldown / wrong server / network block:
         'Authenticating' appears, NS_AUTH_START never appears,
         'AuthTimeoutMonitor-CCP: Timeout!' fires 20 seconds later.
         Nothing from the server — it's ignoring us or we can't
         reach it.

      b) Wrong credentials:
         'Authenticating' appears, 'NS_AUTH_START' appears, but
         PostAuthenticate never happens (the server processed our
         hello but rejected our credentials). Usually also surfaces
         as a dialog we'd normally catch; if we got here, the dialog
         was either missed or dismissed.

      c) Never reached Authenticating:
         Usually means the SSL handshake failed, the server was
         unreachable, or the install4j launcher refused to start.
         Look at the tail of launcher.log for the specific error.

#   RECONNECTACCOUNT  → re-drive the full login flow via attempt_reauth
#   ENABLEAPI         → no-op (ApiOnly=true is already set in jts.ini)
#
# The listener runs in a daemon thread so it dies with the process.
# Single-connection at a time (no concurrency). Bind address is
